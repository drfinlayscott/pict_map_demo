# Pict Map Demo
Proof-of-concept of an R Shiny app with a map with clickable EEZs based on SPC (Pacific Community) PICTs.

It uses the `leaflet` package for plotting the interactive map.

The data comes from [Marine Regions](https://www.marineregions.org).

*Flanders Marine Institute (2023). Maritime Boundaries Geodatabase: Maritime Boundaries and Exclusive Economic Zones (200NM), version 12. https://doi.org/10.14284/632*

The map doesn't do anything at the moment other than show the EEZ name at the point of clicking.
EEZ specific plots or data could be shown instead.

Disclaimer: All errors and cock-ups, including with EEZ locations, naming etc. are mine and nothing to do with SPC or Marine Boundaries.
